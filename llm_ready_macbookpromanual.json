This gives you easy access to the files and folders you used on your old Mac.\n- Â The Applications folder, so most of the applications you used on your other Mac are now on your new MacBook Pro. (You may need to reinstall some of the applications you transfer.)\n\nImportant: Use caution when you transfer applications so that you don't overwrite later versions of the applications already installed on your MacBook Pro.\n\nIf you don't intend to keep or use your other Mac, it's best to deauthorize it from playing music, videos, or audiobooks that you've purchased from the iTunes Music Store. Deauthorizing a computer prevents any songs, videos, or audiobooks you've purchased from being played by someone else and frees up another authorization for use (you can have only five authorized computers at a time for an iTunes account).\n\nIf you don't use Setup Assistant to transfer information when you first start up your computer, you can do it later using Migration Assistant. Go to the Applications folder, open Utilities, and double-click Migration Assistant.\n\nNote: If you used Setup Assistant to transfer information from an older Macintosh and you want to use Migration Assistant to transfer information from it again, make sure FileVault is turned off on the older Macintosh. To turn off FileVault, open the Security pane of System Preferences and click Turn Off FileVault. Follow the onscreen instructions.\n\nSetup Assistant can also take you through the process of setting up your computer to connect to the Internet. For home users, Internet access requires an account with an Internet service provider (ISP). Fees may apply. If you already have an Internet account, see Appendix C, 'Connecting to the Internet,' on page 1 15 for information you'll need to enter.\n\nCongratulations, you're up and running!",

      "full_context": "# Using Setup Assistant, you can transfer:\n\n- Â User accounts, including preferences and email.\n- Â Network settings, so your new MacBook Pro is automatically set up to work with the same network settings as your other Mac.\n- Â Files and folders on the hard disk and partitions. This gives you easy access to the files and folders you used on your old Mac.\n- Â The Applications folder, so most of the applications you used on your other Mac are now on your new MacBook Pro. (You may need to reinstall some of the applications you transfer.)\n\nImportant: Use caution when you transfer applications so that you don't overwrite later versions of the applications already installed on your MacBook Pro.\n\nIf you don't intend to keep or use your other Mac, it's best to deauthorize it from playing music, videos, or audiobooks that you've purchased from the iTunes Music Store. Deauthorizing a computer prevents any songs, videos, or audiobooks you've purchased from being played by someone else and frees up another authorization for use (you can have only five authorized computers at a time for an iTunes account).\n\nIf you don't use Setup Assistant to transfer information when you first start up your computer, you can do it later using Migration Assistant. Go to the Applications folder, open Utilities, and double-click Migration Assistant.\n\nNote: If you used Setup Assistant to transfer information from an older Macintosh and you want to use Migration Assistant to transfer information from it again, make sure FileVault is turned off on the older Macintosh. To turn off FileVault, open the Security pane of System Preferences and click Turn Off FileVault. Follow the onscreen instructions.\n\nSetup Assistant can also take you through the process of setting up your computer to connect to the Internet. For home users, Internet access requires an account with an Internet service provider (ISP). Fees may apply. If you already have an Internet account, see Appendix C, 'Connecting to the Internet,' on page 1 15 for information you'll need to enter.\n\nCongratulations, you're up and running!"

With Bluetooth, you can make short-range wireless connections between desktop and portable computers, personal digital assistants (PDAs), mobile phones, camera phones, printers, digital cameras, and wireless input devices such as the Apple Wireless Keyboard and Apple Wireless Mouse (available for purchase from the online Apple Store at www.apple.com/store).\n\nBluetooth wireless technology eliminates the need for many cables that traditionally connect devices together. Bluetooth enabled devices can connect to each other wirelessly at distances of up to 33 feet (10 meters).\n\nWith Bluetooth wireless technology, you can do the following:\n\n- Â Use your MacBook Pro to communicate with a compatible Bluetooth enabled mobile phone. Your phone can act as a modem to connect you to a wireless service provider, at speeds of up to 56 kilobits per second (kbit/s), so you can use your mobile phone to access the Internet.\n- Â Synchronize with your handheld Bluetooth enabled PDA. Using iSync, you can perform a HotSync operation without cables or send your business card or calendar events directly to a colleague's PDA.\n- Â Exchange files between Bluetooth enabled computers and devices-even Mac to PC.\n- Â Use a Bluetooth wireless printer, keyboard, mouse, or headset."

For more information about using your battery, see 'Understanding Battery Conservation Tips' on page 79.\n\nYou can determine the charge left in your battery by looking at the battery level indicator lights on the battery itself.

You can check the charge with the battery in or out of your MacBook Pro.\n\nIf your battery runs low while you are working, attach your power adapter and let the battery recharge. To replace a low battery with a charged one when you are not connected to a power adapter, it's best to shut down your computer.

The following pages take you through the setup process, including these tasks:\n\n- Â Plugging in the power adapter\n- Â Connecting the cables\n- Â Turning on your MacBook Pro\n- Â Configuring a user account and other settings using Setup Assistant\n\n# Step 1: Plug In the Power Adapter\n\nIf there is protective film around the power adapter, remove it before setting up your MacBook Pro.\n\n- m Insert the AC plug of your power adapter into an outlet and the power adapter plug into the MacBook Pro power adapter port. As you get close to the port, you will feel a magnet, which helps draw and guide the power adapter plug in.\n\nWarning: Make sure the AC plug is fully inserted into the power adapter and the electrical prongs on your AC plug are in their completely extended position before you plug the adapter into the power outlet.\n\nTo extend the reach of your power adapter, you can attach the AC power cord. First, pull up on the AC plug to remove it from the adapter, and then attach the included AC power cord to the adapter. Plug the other end into a power outlet. For an illustration, see page 30.\n\n# Step 2: Connect Your Cables\n\nNext, for an Internet connection, connect your MacBook Pro to a DSL modem, cable modem, external modem, or Ethernet network. If you're connecting to a wireless AirPort Extreme network, you don't need cables.\n\nFor information about types of connections, see Appendix C, 'Connecting to the Internet,' on page 1 15.\n\nNote: Using a dial-up connection requires the external Apple USB Modem, available for purchase from the online Apple Store at www.apple.com/store or from an Apple Authorized Reseller. Plug the Apple USB Modem into a USB port on the MacBook Pro, and then connect a phone cord (not included) from the modem into a phone wall jack.\n\n# To connect to a DSL or cable modem or an Ethernet network:\n\n- m Connect the cable to your DSL or cable modem as shown in the modem instructions, or connect the Ethernet cable to the Ethernet hub or outlet. Then connect the other end of the cable to the computer's Ethernet ( G ) port.\n\n# To connect wirelessly using AirPort:\n\n- 1 Turn AirPort on, if necessary, by choosing 'Turn AirPort on' from the AirPort ( Z ) status menu in the menu bar. AirPort detects available wireless networks.\n\n- 2 Choose a network from the AirPort ( Z ) status menu.\n\n# Step 3: Turn On Your MacBook Pro\n\n- 1 To turn on the MacBook Pro, press the power ( ® ) button briefly (up to 1 second).\n- Do not continue to hold down or press the power button after the startup tone or you might cause the computer to shut down again.\n\nWhen you turn on the computer, you should see the sleep indicator light turn on (and stay on), and you should hear a tone.\n\nIt takes the MacBook Pro a few moments to start up. After it starts up, the sleep indicator light turns off, and Setup Assistant opens automatically.\n\n- 2 Use your MacBook Pro trackpad to select and move items on the screen, just like you use a mouse with a desktop computer.\n- Â To move the arrow pointer on the screen, slide your finger across the trackpad.\n\nImportant: Use only one finger on the trackpad to move the pointer. The trackpad is designed to allow scrolling when you use two fingers and the scrolling feature is turned on by default. See 'Using the Trackpad' on page 31 for more information.\n\n- Â Use the trackpad button to select, click, or double-click items on the screen.\n\n# Problems Turning On the Computer?\n\nNothing happens when you press the power ( ® ) button.\n\n- Â The battery might be drained. Make sure that you plugged the power adapter firmly into both the computer and a power source. The power adapter plug should light when you plug it into the computer.\n- Â If the computer still doesn't start up, see 'Problems That Prevent You From Using Your Computer' on page 94.\n\n# You see a picture of a disk or a folder with a blinking question mark.\n\nThis icon usually means that the computer can't find the system software on the hard disk or any disks attached to the computer. Disconnect all external peripherals and try restarting. Hold down the power ( ® ) button for 8 to 10 seconds until the computer turns off. Then press the power button again. If the problem persists, you might need to reinstall the system software. See 'Reinstalling the Software That Came With Your Computer' on page 99.\n\n# Step 4: Configuring With Setup Assistant\n\nThe first time you turn on your computer, Setup Assistant starts. Setup Assistant helps you enter your Internet and email information and set up a user account on your computer.\n\nIf you already have a Mac, Setup Assistant can help you automatically transfer files, applications, and other information from your previous Mac to your new MacBook Pro.\n\n# To transfer information, make sure:\n\n- Â Your other Mac has built-in FireWire and supports FireWire Target Disk Mode\n- Â Your other Mac has Mac OS X v10.1 or later installed\n- Â You have a standard 6-pin to 6-pin FireWire cable\n\nSetup Assistant takes you through the process of transferring your information-just follow the onscreen instructions. Transferring information to your MacBook Pro does not affect the information on your other Mac. (If you set up partitions on the new MacBook Pro, all information from the other Mac will be transferred to one partition.)\n\n# Using Setup Assistant, you can transfer:\n\n- Â User accounts, including preferences and email.\n- Â Network settings, so your new MacBook Pro is automatically set up to work with the same network settings as your other Mac.\n- Â Files and folders on the hard disk and partitions. This gives you easy access to the files and folders you used on your old Mac.\n- Â The Applications folder, so most of the applications you used on your other Mac are now on your new MacBook Pro. (You may need to reinstall some of the applications you transfer.)\n\nImportant: Use caution when you transfer applications so that you don't overwrite later versions of the applications already installed on your MacBook Pro.\n\nIf you don't intend to keep or use your other Mac, it's best to deauthorize it from playing music, videos, or audiobooks that you've purchased from the iTunes Music Store. Deauthorizing a computer prevents any songs, videos, or audiobooks you've purchased from being played by someone else and frees up another authorization for use (you can have only five authorized computers at a time for an iTunes account).\n\nIf you don't use Setup Assistant to transfer information when you first start up your computer, you can do it later using Migration Assistant. Go to the Applications folder, open Utilities, and double-click Migration Assistant.\n\nNote: If you used Setup Assistant to transfer information from an older Macintosh and you want to use Migration Assistant to transfer information from it again, make sure FileVault is turned off on the older Macintosh. To turn off FileVault, open the Security pane of System Preferences and click Turn Off FileVault. Follow the onscreen instructions.\n\nSetup Assistant can also take you through the process of setting up your computer to connect to the Internet. For home users, Internet access requires an account with an Internet service provider (ISP). Fees may apply. If you already have an Internet account, see Appendix C, 'Connecting to the Internet,' on page 1 15 for information you'll need to enter.\n\nCongratulations, you're up and running!\n\n# Built-in iSight camera and camera indicator light\n\nVideoconference with others using the included iChat AV application.

When the computer is in sleep, you can quickly wake it and bypass the startup process.\n\n# To put the computer to sleep, do one of the following:\n\n- Â Close the display.\n- Â Choose Apple (  ) &gt; Sleep from the menu bar.\n- Â Press the power ( ® ) button and click Sleep in the dialog that appears.\n- Â Choose Apple (  ) &gt; System Preferences, click Energy Saver, and set a sleep timer.\n- Â Press and hold the Play/Pause ( ' ) button on the Apple Remote for 3 seconds.\n\nWarning: Wait a few seconds until the white sleep indicator light on the display latch starts pulsating (indicating that the computer is in sleep and the hard disk has stopped spinning) before you move your MacBook Pro. Moving your computer while the hard disk is spinning can damage the hard disk, causing loss of data or the inability to start up from the hard disk.\n\n# To wake the computer:\n\n- Â If the display is closed, simply open it to wake up your MacBook Pro.\n- Â If the display is already open, press the power ( ® ) button or any key on the keyboard or any button on the Apple Remote.\n\n# Shutting Down Your MacBook Pro\n\nIf you aren't going to use your MacBook Pro for a day or two, it's best to shut it down. The sleep indicator light goes on briefly during the shutdown process.\n\n# To shut down your computer, do one of the following:\n\n- m Choose Apple (  ) &gt; Shut Down from the menu bar.\n- m Press the power ( ® ) button and click Shut Down in the dialog that appears.\n\nIf you plan to store your MacBook Pro for an extended period of time, see 'Storing Your MacBook Pro' on page 108 for information about how to prevent your battery from draining completely.\n\n# Calibrating Your Battery\n\nTo get the longest running time from your battery, calibrate it sometime during the first week you have your MacBook Pro and repeat these steps occasionally to keep your battery functioning at its fullest capacity.\n\n# To calibrate your battery:\n\n- 1 Plug in the power adapter and fully charge your MacBook Pro battery until the light on the power adapter plug changes to green and the Battery icon in the menu bar indicates that the battery is fully charged.\n- 2 Allow the battery to rest in the fully charged state for two hours or longer. You may use your computer during this time as long as the adapter is plugged in.\n- 3 Disconnect the power adapter with the MacBook Pro on and start running it from the battery. You may use your computer during this time.\n- When your battery gets low, you will see the low battery warning dialog on the screen.\n- 4 Continue to keep your computer turned on until it goes to sleep. Save your work and close all applications when the battery gets low and before the system goes to sleep.\n- 5 Turn off the computer or allow it to sleep for five hours or longer.\n- 6 Connect the power adapter and leave it connected until the battery is fully charged again.\n\nImportant: Repeat the calibration process occasionally to keep your battery fully functioning. If you use your MacBook Pro infrequently, it's best to recalibrate the battery at least once a month.\n\nIf you purchased additional batteries, follow the calibration procedure with those batteries as well. For more battery information, see 'Using Your Battery' on page 77.\n\n# Getting More Information\n\nFor more information about your MacBook Pro, check out these resources:\n\n- Â Read Chapter 2, 'Getting to Know Your MacBook Pro,' on page 27 for important basics.\n- Â If you're unfamiliar with Mac OS X, review the Welcome to Tiger booklet that came with your computer and open Mac Help to browse the information there. For more information, see 'Getting Answers Using Mac Help' on page 42.\n- Â If you're having a problem that prevents you from using your computer, see Chapter 5, 'Troubleshooting,' on page 93.\n- Â Check out the most commonly asked questions in 'Top Ten Questions' on page 125.\n- Â For support information, user discussion boards, and the latest Apple software downloads, go to www.apple.com/support.\n- Â If you can't find the answer to your question in these places, see the AppleCare materials that came with your computer for information about contacting Apple.\n\n2\n\n# Getting to Know Your MacBook Pro\n\n2\n\n# This chapter introduces important basics about your MacBook Pro.\n\nWhenever you stop using your MacBook Pro, wait a few moments to let the hard disk and any disc (such as a CD or DVD) in your optical drive stop spinning before you transport the computer. Avoid jostling or bumping your MacBook Pro while discs are spinning.\n\nNote: Your MacBook Pro uses Sudden Motion Sensor technology to help protect the hard disk if the computer is dropped or experiences extreme vibration. See 'Understanding Sudden Motion Sensor Technology' on page 76 for more information.\n\nWhen you use your MacBook Pro or charge its battery, it is normal for the bottom of the case to get warm. For prolonged use, place your MacBook Pro on a flat, stable surface. The bottom of the case is raised slightly to allow airflow, which keeps the unit within normal operating temperatures.\n\nAs you get to know your new MacBook Pro, you might hear system sounds during startup and when using your hard disk and optical drive. After the MacBook Pro runs for some time, small fans might turn on to cool it, producing a faint sound. System sounds such as these are part of the computer's normal functioning.\n\nFor more safety instructions about handling and using your MacBook Pro in different locations, make sure to see Appendix B, 'Safety, Use, and Care Information,' on page 105.\n\nThe rest of this chapter includes sections about using components of your MacBook Pro, such as the display, power adapter, trackpad, keyboard, built-in iSight camera, and Apple Remote, and information about Mac OS X, Mac Help, applications, and connecting to peripheral hardware.\n\n# Adjusting Your Display\n\nYour MacBook Pro is equipped with an ambient light sensing (ALS) system (located under the speaker grille) that automatically adjusts the brightness of the display according to the available light. After you begin working with your new MacBook Pro, you might need to adjust your display so that the screen is easier to see. Use the F1 and F2 keys labeled with the brightness ( ¤ ) icon to adjust screen brightness.\n\n# To turn off the automatic display brightness feature:\n\n- m Choose Apple (  ) &gt; System Preferences from the menu bar. Open the Displays pane and deselect the 'Automatically adjust brightness as ambient light changes' checkbox.\n\nThere are two options for your display that can optimize your battery life. You can find these options in the Energy Saver pane of System Preferences.\n\n# To set preferences for your display that optimize battery use:\n\n- 1 Open System Preferences and click Energy Saver.\n- 2 In the 'Settings for' pop-up menu, choose Battery and click Options.\n\n- 3 Deselect 'Reduce the brightness of the built-in display when using this power source' if you don't want your display to dim to save on battery consumption.\n\nWhen this feature is enabled, your display dims a small amount when you go from using the power adapter with your MacBook Pro to using battery power. When you plug in the power adapter again, your display returns to its previous level of brightness. Deselect 'Automatically reduce the brightness of the display before display sleep' if you don't want the display to dim before the MacBook Pro sleeps.\n\n# Changing the Size of Images on the Screen\n\nYour MacBook Pro has a 15.4-inch display with a default resolution of 1440 x 900. You can increase or decrease the size of images on your screen by switching from the native resolution to a scaled resolution.\n\nYou can choose scaled resolutions in the Displays pane of System Preferences. When you switch to a scaled resolution, items on the screen appear larger, making them easier to see. Scaled resolutions might not be as sharp as the display's default resolution.\n\nWith some resolutions, a black band appears on each side of the display. If you do not want to see the bands, you can choose a 'stretched' version of the resolution to have the image cover the entire screen and eliminate the bands.\n\n# To adjust the resolution on your display:\n\n- m Choose Apple (  ) &gt; System Preferences from the menu bar. Open the Displays pane of System Preferences.\n\nTo control your display settings using the Displays status menu in the menu bar, click 'Show displays in menu bar.'\n\n# Using Your Power Adapter\n\nPlugging in the power adapter provides AC power to the MacBook Pro and recharges the computer's battery.\n\nImportant: For optimal performance, use only the power adapter that came with your computer, or purchase an additional 85W Apple Portable Power Adapter.\n\nWhen you first connect your power adapter to your computer, an indicator light on the power adapter plug turns on. If you don't see a light, your plug is probably not seated correctly. Check for any debris and remove it, if necessary. An amber light indicates that power is going to the battery. A green light indicates that no power is going to the battery, which can mean the battery is fully charged, is not installed, or has a problem. You can monitor the battery level using the Battery status menu in the menu bar or by checking the battery level indicator lights on the bottom of the battery (see page 77).\n\nWarning: The MacBook Pro power adapter port contains a magnet that can erase data on a credit card, iPod, or other device. To preserve your data, keep these and other magnetic media away from the power adapter port.\n\nTo extend the reach of your power adapter, first pull the AC plug up to remove it from the adapter. Attach the included AC power cord to the adapter, making sure it is seated firmly. Plug the other end into a power outlet. The AC power cord provides a grounded connection.\n\nFor best results, always use the AC power cord and connect it to a grounded power outlet when one is available. Use only the AC power cord that came with your power adapter. Make sure to push the power plug snugly into the power adapter port on the computer to ensure it is engaged and power is flowing to the computer. If the cord is plugged in properly, you will see an indicator light on the end of the cord that plugs into your MacBook Pro.\n\nWhen disconnecting the power adapter from a power outlet or from the computer, pull the plug, not the cord. For safety instructions about using your power adapter, see 'Setting Up Your MacBook Pro and Power Adapter' on page 106.\n\n# Using the Trackpad\n\nHow quickly the pointer moves onscreen is based on how quickly you move your finger across the trackpad. To move the pointer a short distance, move your finger slowly across the trackpad; the faster you move your finger, the farther the pointer moves onscreen.\n\nYou can also scroll vertically and horizontally in a window that has scroll bars by moving two fingers on the trackpad. This feature can be turned off or adjusted in the Keyboard &amp; Mouse pane of System Preferences.\n\n# Tips for Using the Trackpad\n\nFor best results when using the trackpad, keep in mind these tips:\n\n- Â Use only one finger, except when the scrolling feature is turned on and you want to scroll.\n- Â Do not use a pen or any other object.\n- Â Keep your finger and the trackpad dry. If the trackpad becomes moist from humidity or condensation, gently wipe it with a clean cloth before you use it.\n- Â Never use any kind of cleaning solution on the trackpad.\n\nFor more information about using the trackpad, choose Help &gt; Mac Help from the menu bar at the top of the screen.\n\nInstead of using the trackpad button, you can use your finger to click and double-click directly on the trackpad. You can turn on this feature and other trackpad options in the Keyboard &amp; Mouse pane of System Preferences.\n\nNote: If you find that the pointer moves as you type because you accidentally brush the trackpad, you can avoid this problem by selecting the 'Ignore accidental trackpad input' option in the Keyboard &amp; Mouse pane of System Preferences.\n\n# Using the Keyboard\n\nYour MacBook Pro keyboard has a numeric keypad incorporated in the standard keyboard keys. Keys used for the numeric keypad have a smaller secondary label.\n\nTo use the numeric keypad, press the Num Lock key. The Num Lock key glows green, indicating that the keypad is active. When you finish using the keypad, press the Num Lock key again to turn it off.\n\nImportant: If your keyboard doesn't seem to be working correctly, check the Num Lock key. When the numeric keypad is active, other keys and keyboard equivalents for menu commands (such as x -Q to quit) are deactivated.\n\nYour MacBook Pro is equipped with an illuminated keyboard that is adjusted by the ambient light sensing (ALS) system according to the available light in your operating environment.\n\nYou can also adjust the keyboard illumination using the F8, F9, and F10 keys.\n\nImportant: Even when the keyboard illumination feature is on, the keyboard illuminates only in low-light situations.\n\nYou can turn off the keyboard illumination feature in the Keyboard &amp; Mouse pane of System Preferences or by pressing the F8 key.\n\nNote: Exposé is preset to use the F9 and F10 keys, the same keys that adjust your keyboard illumination. To use Exposé to manage your desktop windows, hold down the Fn key and press F9 or F10, or open the Dashboard &amp; Exposé pane in System Preferences and choose different function keys to manage the windows.\n\nYou can use your keyboard as well as your Apple Remote to control the Front Row application. See 'Using the Keyboard to Control Front Row' on page 38.\n\nIf you like to use keyboard shortcuts to work efficiently, choose Help &gt; Mac Help from the menu bar and search for 'navigation shortcuts.' You'll find a list of keyboard shortcuts for many common procedures and applications.\n\n# Using a Mouse\n\nIf you have an Apple mouse with a USB connection, you can insert the USB connector into the USB 2.0 port and use your mouse right away. If you want to use an Apple wireless mouse with Bluetooth ® technology, see 'Using Bluetooth Wireless Technology' on page 64 for information about connecting it. You can purchase a wireless or USB mouse from the online Apple Store at www.apple.com/store or from an Apple Authorized Reseller.\n\n# Using the Apple Remote and Front Row\n\nYour Apple Remote works with the Front Row interface and the built-in infrared (IR) receiver, which is located next to the display release button on your MacBook Pro. Use the Apple Remote to open Front Row and work with iTunes, iPhoto, QuickTime, DVD Player, and more from across the room.\n\n# Use your Apple Remote to:\n\n- Â Open Front Row and navigate through the Music, Photos, Videos, and DVD menus.\n- Â Adjust the volume of a song, play or pause a song, or skip to the next or previous track in iTunes.\n- Â Play a slideshow of any of your photo albums in iPhoto.\n- Â Play movies that are in your Movies folder or watch online QuickTime movie trailers.\n- Â Play a DVD in your optical drive with DVD Player.\n- Â Sleep or wake your MacBook Pro.\n\n# To use your Apple Remote:\n\n- Â Press the Menu ( » ) button to open Front Row.\n- Â Use the Menu ( » ) button to return to the previous menu while you're navigating.\n- Â Press the Volume/Menu Up ( ∂ ) and Volume/Menu Down ( D ) buttons to move through the menu options and adjust the volume.\n- Â Press the Select/Play/Pause ( ' ) button to select an option from the menu.\n- Â Press the Select/Play/Pause ( ' ) button to play or pause a song, slideshow, or movie.\n- Â Press the Next/Fast-forward ( ' ) or Previous/Rewind ( ] ) button to skip to the next or previous song in iTunes or the next or previous chapter in a DVD movie.\n\n- 36\n- Â Hold down the Next/Fast-forward ( ' ) or Previous/Rewind ( ] ) button to fast-forward or rewind within a song or movie.\n- Â Hold down the Play/Pause ( ' ) button for 3 seconds to put your MacBook Pro to sleep.\n\n# Pairing Your Apple Remote\n\nIf you have multiple computers or other devices with built-in IR receivers in a room (for example, more than one MacBook Pro or iMac in a home office or lab), you can 'pair' your Apple Remote with a specific computer or device.

Occasionally, unusually strong vibrations might activate the Sudden Motion Sensor technology at a time when your MacBook Pro is writing or reading data intensively (such as when playing or recording video or audio). If you notice dropped frames or sound elements, make sure that your MacBook Pro is in a stable environment without vibration or abrupt movement.\n\n# Using Your Battery\n\nWhen the external power adapter is not connected, your computer draws power from its battery. The length of time that you can run your MacBook Pro varies, depending on the applications you use and the external devices connected to your MacBook Pro. Turning off features such as AirPort Extreme or Bluetooth wireless technology can help conserve battery charge. For more information about using your battery, see 'Understanding Battery Conservation Tips' on page 79.\n\nYou can determine the charge left in your battery by looking at the battery level indicator lights on the battery itself. Press the button next to the lights and the lights glow to show how much charge is left in the battery. The indicator lights remain lit for a few seconds after you press the button. You can check the charge with the battery in or out of your MacBook Pro.\n\nIf your battery runs low while you are working, attach your power adapter and let the battery recharge. To replace a low battery with a charged one when you are not connected to a power adapter, it's best to shut down your computer. If you put your MacBook Pro to sleep to replace the battery, wait until the sleep indicator light is pulsating before removing the battery. Although your computer will shut down when you remove the battery, you won't lose any data.\n\nImportant: If only one flashing light is on, very little charge is left. If no lights are visible, the battery is completely drained and the computer will not start up unless the power adapter is connected. Plug in the power adapter to let the battery recharge, or replace the drained battery with a fully charged battery (see page 78).\n\nIf the battery icon in the Finder menu bar is set to show the percentage of charge, you might sometimes notice that the battery does not attain a full 100 percent charge when the power adapter is attached. This is normal behavior; battery life is maximized if charging is not continuously cycled on and off when the battery's charge capacity is between 95 and 100 percent. When the battery level eventually drops below 95 percent, it will charge all the way to 100 percent.\n\n# Removing and Replacing the Battery\n\nFor instructions on removing and replacing the battery, see 'Installing Additional Memory' on page 84.\n\nNote: Dispose of batteries according to your local environmental laws and guidelines. For more information, see 'Disposal and Recycling Information' on page 133.\n\n# Charging a Battery\n\nWhen the power adapter that came with your computer is connected, the battery recharges whether the computer is off, on, or in sleep. However, the battery recharges more quickly if the computer is off or in sleep. When the MacBook Pro is on, you can monitor the battery charge level using the Battery status menu in the menu bar.\n\nThe battery charge level displayed is based on the amount of power left in the battery with the applications, peripheral devices, and system settings (display brightness, Energy Saver settings, and so on) you are currently using. To conserve battery power, close applications and disconnect peripheral devices not in use, and adjust your Energy Saver settings (see the next section).\n\n# Understanding Battery Conservation Tips\n\nThe amount of work time your MacBook Pro battery can provide before you need to recharge depends on the applications and peripheral devices you're currently using and the steps you take to conserve power while you work.\n\n# For the best conservation of battery power, do the following:\n\n- Â Disconnect bus-powered USB or FireWire devices when they are not in use.\n\n- Â Turn off AirPort or Bluetooth when they are not in use. (Use the AirPort and Bluetooth status menus in the menu bar. If these icons don't appear in the menu bar, you can turn them on in the Network and Bluetooth panes of System Preferences.)\n- Â Quit open applications that you are not using.\n- Â Remove CD and DVD discs when they are not in use.\n- Â Reduce screen brightness using the brightness controls on the MacBook Pro keyboard.\n- Â Set the hard disk to spin down after a short time. In the Energy Saver pane of System Preferences, select the 'Put the hard disk to sleep when possible' option.\n- Â Set your MacBook Pro to sleep after inactivity of five minutes or less.\n- Â Your MacBook Pro is preset to automatically reduce its processing speed during periods of light processing activity when using battery power, thus reducing power usage. The setting that determines this is the Normal option in the Optimization popup menu of the Energy Saver pane of System Preferences. During periods of high processing activity, your computer will automatically switch to a higher processing speed. To conserve the most battery life, choose Better Battery Life from the Optimization pop-up menu. Be aware that choosing this option may affect your computer's performance. To set your computer to use its highest processing speed at all times, choose Better Performance.\n\n# Getting More Information About Your MacBook Pro Battery\n\nAdditional information is available in Mac Help.

However, to ensure safe usage, it is important that safety instructions marked on the product and in the documentation are followed.\n\n# Understanding General Safety Instructions\n\nRead and follow all instructions marked on the product and in this manual before operating your MacBook Pro. Keep these instructions handy for reference by you and others.\n\n- Â Set up your MacBook Pro on a stable work surface.\n- Â Keep your computer away from sources of liquids, such as drinks, washbasins, bathtubs, shower stalls, and so on.\n- Â Protect your computer from dampness or wet weather, such as rain, snow, and fog.\n- Â For your own safety and that of your equipment, always take the following precautions. Disconnect the power plug (by pulling the plug, not the cord), remove the battery, and disconnect the phone cord if any of the following conditions exists:\n- Â You want to install memory.\n\n- Â You want to remove any parts.\n- Â The power cord or plug becomes frayed or otherwise damaged.\n- Â You spill something into the case.\n- Â Your computer is exposed to rain or any other excess moisture.\n- Â Your computer has been dropped or the case has been otherwise damaged.\n- Â You suspect that your computer needs service or repair.\n- Â You want to clean the case (use only the recommended procedure described later).\n- Â The MacBook Pro power adapter port contains a magnet. Do not place magnetically sensitive material or devices within 1 inch (25 mm) of this port.\n- Â Never push objects of any kind into the MacBook Pro ventilation openings.\n- Â Use caution when handling the battery. There is risk of explosion if the battery is replaced by an incorrect type. Dispose of used batteries according to your local environmental guidelines. Don't puncture, drop, or incinerate the battery.\n\n# Setting Up Your MacBook Pro and Power Adapter\n\nEnsure the AC plug or AC power cord is fully inserted into the power adapter before plugging the adapter into a power outlet. For best results, connect the adapter using the AC power cord and use a grounded power outlet.\n\nUse only the power adapter that came with your MacBook Pro. Adapters for other electronic devices (including other MacBook Pro models and other portable computers) might look similar, but they can negatively affect your computer's performance or damage your computer.\n\nThe power adapter may become hot during normal use of your MacBook Pro. Always allow adequate ventilation around the adapter and use care when handling during or immediately after operation.\n\nNever force a connector into a port. Check for obstructions on the port. If the connector and port don't join with reasonable ease, they probably don't match. Make sure that the connector matches the port and that you have positioned the connector correctly in relation to the port.\n\nIf debris gets into the power adapter port, it can prevent the power adapter from seating properly. Remove debris gently with a cotton swab.\n\n# Using Your MacBook Pro\n\nWhen you're using your MacBook Pro or charging the battery, it is normal for the bottom of the case to get warm. For prolonged use, place your MacBook Pro on a flat, stable surface.\n\nDo not leave the bottom of your MacBook Pro in contact with your lap or any surface of your body for extended periods. Prolonged contact with your body could cause discomfort and potentially a burn.\n\nThe bottom of the MacBook Pro case functions as a cooling surface that transfers heat from inside the computer to the cooler air outside. The bottom of the case is raised slightly to allow airflow that keeps the unit within normal operating temperatures. In addition, warm air is vented from the slots in the back of the case.\n\nWarning: Do not place your MacBook Pro on a pillow or other soft material when it is on, as the material can block the airflow vents, in particular the rear vents, and cause the computer to overheat. Never place anything over your keyboard when operating in closed-lid mode. This can cause your computer to cycle on and off which might create excessive heat and drain your battery. Never turn on your computer unless all of its internal and external parts are in place. Operating the computer when it is open or missing parts can be dangerous and can damage your computer.\n\n# Carrying Your MacBook Pro\n\nIf you carry your MacBook Pro in a bag or briefcase, make sure that there are no loose items (such as paper clips or coins) that could accidentally get inside the computer through an opening such as the optical drive slot or get stuck inside a port.\n\n# Storing Your MacBook Pro\n\nIf you are going to store your MacBook Pro for an extended period of time, keep it in a cool location (ideally, 71° F or 22° C) and do one of the following to preserve your MacBook Pro battery life:\n\n- Â Discharge the battery 50 percent before storing your MacBook Pro.\n- Â When storing your computer for longer than five months, discharge the battery to approximately 50 percent and then remove it from the MacBook Pro. If you are storing your computer for an extended period, recharge your battery to 50 percent every six months or so.\n\n# Cleaning Your MacBook Pro\n\nFollow these general rules when cleaning the outside of your computer and its components:\n\n- Â Shut down your MacBook Pro, unplug the power adapter, and remove the battery.\n- Â Use a damp, soft, lint-free cloth to clean the computer's exterior. Avoid getting moisture in any openings. Do not spray liquid directly on the computer.\n- Â Don't use aerosol sprays, solvents, or abrasives.\n\n# Cleaning Your MacBook Pro Display\n\nTo clean your MacBook Pro screen, do the following:\n\n- Â Shut down your MacBook Pro, unplug the power adapter, and remove the battery.\n- Â Dampen a clean, soft, lint-free cloth or paper with water only and wipe the screen. Do not spray liquid directly on the screen.\n\n# Avoiding Hearing Damage\n\nWarning: Permanent hearing loss may occur if earbuds or headphones are used at high volume. You can adapt over time to a higher volume of sound that may sound normal but can be damaging to your hearing. If you experience ringing in your ears or muffled speech, stop listening and have your hearing checked. The louder the volume, the less time is required before your hearing could be affected. Hearing experts suggest that to protect your hearing:\n\n- Â Limit the amount of time you use earbuds or headphones at high volume.\n- Â Avoid turning up the volume to block out noisy surroundings.\n- Â Turn the volume down if you can't hear people speaking near you.\n\n# Laser Information\n\nWarning: Making adjustments or performing procedures other than those specified in your equipment's manual may result in hazardous radiation exposure.\n\nDo not attempt to disassemble the cabinet containing the laser. The laser beam used in this product is harmful to the eyes. The use of optical instruments, such as magnifying lenses, with this product increases the potential hazard to your eyes. For your safety, have this equipment serviced only by an Apple-authorized service provider.\n\nBecause of the optical disc drive in your computer, your computer is a Class 1 laser product. The Class 1 label, located in a user-accessible area, indicates that the drive meets minimum safety requirements. A service warning label is located in a service-accessible area. The labels on your product may differ slightly from the ones shown here.\n\nClass 1 label\n\nService warning label\n\n# High-Risk Activities Warning\n\nThis computer system is not intended for use in the operation of nuclear facilities, aircraft navigation or communications systems, or air traffic control machines, or for any other uses where the failure of the computer system could lead to death, personal injury, or severe environmental damage.\n\n# Understanding Ergonomics\n\nHere are some tips for setting up a healthy work environment.\n\n# Keyboard and Trackpad\n\nWhen you use the keyboard and trackpad, your shoulders should be relaxed. Your upper arm and forearm should form an angle that is slightly greater than a right angle, with your wrist and hand in roughly a straight line.\n\nThis\n\nUse a light touch when typing or using the trackpad and keep your hands and fingers relaxed. Avoid rolling your thumbs under your palms.\n\nNot this\n\nThis\n\nAppendix B Safety, Use, and Care Information\n\nChange hand positions often to avoid fatigue. Some computer users might develop discomfort in their hands, wrists, or arms after intensive work without breaks. If you begin to develop chronic pain or discomfort in your hands, wrists, or arms, consult a qualified health specialist.\n\n# Chair\n\nAn adjustable chair that provides firm, comfortable support is best. Adjust the height of the chair so your thighs are horizontal and your feet flat on the floor. The back of the chair should support your lower back (lumbar region). Follow the manufacturer's instructions for adjusting the backrest to fit your body properly.\n\nYou might have to raise your chair so that your forearms and hands are at the proper angle to the keyboard. If this makes it impossible to rest your feet flat on the floor, you can use a footrest with adjustable height and tilt to make up for any gap between the floor and your feet. Or you might lower the desktop to eliminate the need for a footrest. Another option is to use a desk with a keyboard tray that's lower than the regular work surface.\n\n# External Mouse\n\nIf you use an external mouse, position the mouse at the same height as your keyboard and within a comfortable reach.\n\n# Built-in Display\n\nAdjust the angle of the display to minimize glare and reflections from overhead lights and windows. Do not force the display if you meet resistance. The display is not meant to open more than 120 degrees.\n\nYou can adjust the brightness of the screen when you take the computer from one work location to another, or if the lighting in your work area changes.\n\n# Getting More Information\n\nGo to www.apple.com/about/ergonomics.\n\n# Apple and the Environment\n\nApple Computer, Inc., recognizes its responsibility to minimize the environmental impacts of its operations and products.
