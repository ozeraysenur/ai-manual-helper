Three modes to choose from, to suit any task on any floor type.\n\n# Caring for your floors\n\nclick click Check that the underside of the cleaner head or tool is clean and free from any objects that may cause damage.\n\nBefore vacuuming your flooring, rugs, and carpets, check the manufacturer's recommended cleaning instructions.\n\nThe brush bar on your machine can damage certain carpet types and floors. Some carpets will fuzz if a rotating brush bar is used when vacuuming. If this happens, we recommend vacuuming without the motorised floor tool and consulting with your flooring manufacturer.\n\n# Charging your machine\n\nConnect to the charger either directly or in the dock.\n\nYour machine won't operate or charge if the ambient temperature is below 5°C (41°F).

Be careful not to touch the power button and be aware of sharp objects.\n\nLeave your machine to cool down before looking for blockages.\n\nDon't use your machine when looking for blockages as this could cause injury.\n\nIf your machine detects a blockage, the motor will pulse six times. You won't be able to use your machine until the blockage has been cleared.\n\nIf you try to use your machine when the motor is pulsing, it will automatically cut out.\n\nLeave your machine to cool down before looking for blockages and, for your safety, take care not to touch the trigger.\n\n# Clearing obstructions from your Motorbar™ cleaner head\n\nYour Motorbar™ cleaner head doesn't have a washable brush bar.
